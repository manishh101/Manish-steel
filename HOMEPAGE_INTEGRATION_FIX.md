# Homepage Integration Fix - Most Selling & Top Products

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### **1. API Service Integration**
- âœ… Fixed `CleanTopProductsSection` to use correct API (`/api/products/top-products`)
- âœ… Fixed `CleanMostSellingSection` to use correct API (`/api/products/most-selling`)
- âœ… Changed import from `productService` to main `api` service

### **2. Admin Panel Controls**
- âœ… Added clickable buttons for "Most Selling" and "Top Product" status
- âœ… Buttons show current status with visual indicators
- âœ… Click to toggle status on/off for each product
- âœ… Real-time status updates in admin panel

### **3. Homepage Display Logic**
- âœ… Products marked as `isMostSelling: true` appear in "Most Selling" section
- âœ… Products marked as `isTopProduct: true` appear in "Our Top Products" section
- âœ… Each section shows up to 6 products as configured
